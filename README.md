## :gear: Key Features

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Every commit triggers an automated build, ensuring that integration is a breeze.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Seamless and automated deployment processes make releases a non-event.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Our infrastructure is defined in code, making it as easy to handle as our application code.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Leveraging Version Control (Git) and collaboration tools to foster a cooperative working environment.
- **Automated Testing**: A comprehensive suite ensures our application stands tall against the tides of change.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:Employing Prometheus for real-time monitoring of application performance.
- **Security Scanning**: Integrating SonarQube for continuous security scanning within the CI/CD pipeline.

## :wrench: Environment Setup

- **Security**: SonarQube

## :test_tube: CI/CD Pipeline

![CI/CD Pipeline](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Our CI/CD pipeline is engineered to facilitate automated builds and deployments, incorporating multiple phases such as testing and security scanning, to ensure the integrity and quality of our application.

## :white_check_mark: Automated Testing

Automated tests are a cornerstone of our quality assurance process. We employ a range of testing techniques to ensure application reliability.

## :closed_lock_with_key: Monitoring and Security

We monitor application performance and security continuously, ensuring high availability and identifying vulnerabilities swiftly.

## :memo: Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available covering our deployment pipeline and troubleshooting steps.

## :arrows_clockwise: Feedback Loop

Continuous enhancement is integral to our process. We incorporate insights from monitoring and user feedback to refine and advance our application's development

## :busts_in_silhouette: Team Collaboration

Our project uses Jira for sprint planning and task management, ensuring efficient tracking of the development process.

## :satellite: Live Website
